## Hi there 👋

## About Me

#### I am Mike Zahuta, a _developing_ developer who wants to learn everything! After years of selling software, my curiosity to learn how platforms worked got the best of me. I changed jobs, went back to school, and am excited to see how far I go on the road ahead.

## 📈 Currently...
- 🔭 Working on small projects to develop further skills and add to my portfolio. (Feel free to suggest!)
- 💻 Focused on mastering PERN/MERN stack development for now.
- 👾 Keeping up to date on other languages - Go is next!
- 👯 Eager to collaborate on open source projects, especially if they're climate impact focused.
- 🤔 Listening for lessons, best practices, all the tips and tricks any decent developer should know.
- 💬 Ask me about anything - especially how/why I've built something. Explanation will help my development.
- 📫 How to reach me: mike.zahuta@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I completed my switch to Software Development with 3 year old twins and a 3 month old all at home during the pandemic. 😬

## 🏆 Achievements...
- ✅ Successfully completed General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Jan 2021 on a terribly slow Macbook Air 2013
